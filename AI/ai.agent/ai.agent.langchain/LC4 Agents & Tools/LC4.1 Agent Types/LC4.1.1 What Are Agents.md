| **[[LC4.1.1.1 Agent Concept]]**                       | Understand what agents are                   | Autonomous programs, goal-driven, decision-making entities                      | Agents are autonomous programs that make decisions.                 |
| **[[LC4.1.1.2 Autonomous Decision-Making]]**          | Know agent autonomy                          | Choose actions, select tools, self-directed execution                           | Agents autonomously choose actions and tools.                       |
| **[[LC4.1.1.3 Reasoning + Action Loop]]**             | Understand the ReAct loop                    | Think-Act-Observe cycle, iterative reasoning, action refinement                 | Agents reason, act, observe, then repeat.                           |
| **[[LC4.1.1.4 Agent vs Chain Distinction]]**          | Compare agents and chains                    | Chains are deterministic, agents decide dynamically                             | Chains are fixed; agents decide at runtime.                         |
| **[[LC4.1.1.5 When Agents Excel]]**                   | Know agent use cases                         | Complex tasks, unknown paths, tool selection needed                             | Use agents when task path isn't predetermined.                      |
