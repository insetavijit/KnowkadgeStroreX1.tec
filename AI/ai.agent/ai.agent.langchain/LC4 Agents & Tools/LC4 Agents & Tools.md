# [[LC4 Agents & Tools]]

Master LangChain agents—autonomous systems that use tools and reasoning to accomplish tasks. Learn agent types, tool creation, ReAct, and agent executors. Understand tool selection, error handling, and agent patterns. While LangGraph offers more control, LangChain agents provide rapid prototyping and simpler use cases. Understanding both enables choosing the right tool for each job.
