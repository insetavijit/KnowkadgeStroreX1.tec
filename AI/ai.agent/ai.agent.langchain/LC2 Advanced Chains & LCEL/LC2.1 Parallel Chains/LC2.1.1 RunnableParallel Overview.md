| **[[LC2.1.1.1 What Is RunnableParallel]]**            | Define parallel execution                    | RunnableParallel class, concurrent chains, parallel composition                 | RunnableParallel runs multiple chains concurrently.                 |
| **[[LC2.1.1.2 Concurrent Execution Concept]]**        | Understand concurrency benefits              | Parallel vs sequential, time savings, independent operations                    | Parallel execution runs chains simultaneously for speed.            |
| **[[LC2.1.1.3 Parallel vs Sequential]]**              | Compare execution modes                      | When to parallelize, dependencies, performance trade-offs                       | Use parallel when chains have no dependencies.                      |
| **[[LC2.1.1.4 Use Cases for Parallel Chains]]**       | Identify appropriate scenarios               | Multiple retrievals, parallel API calls, fan-out processing                     | Parallelize independent operations like multiple searches.          |
| **[[LC2.1.1.5 Parallel Chain Benefits]]**             | Summarize advantages                         | Reduced latency, efficient resource use, throughput gains                       | Parallel chains reduce total execution time.                        |
