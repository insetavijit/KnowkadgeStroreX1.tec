| **[[LC2.1.7.1 When Parallelization Helps]]**          | Identify optimization opportunities          | I/O-bound operations, independent tasks, network calls                          | Parallelize I/O-bound, independent operations for gains.            |
| **[[LC2.1.7.2 Overhead Considerations]]**             | Account for parallelization costs            | Task creation overhead, context switching, memory usage                         | Consider overhead; parallel isn't always faster.                    |
| **[[LC2.1.7.3 Optimal Branching]]**                   | Choose right number of branches              | Too few vs too many, diminishing returns, resource limits                       | Balance branch count against overhead and resources.                |
| **[[LC2.1.7.4 Benchmarking Parallel Chains]]**        | Measure performance                          | Timing comparisons, profiling, metrics collection                               | Benchmark to verify parallel chains improve performance.            |
| **[[LC2.1.7.5 Optimization Best Practices]]**         | Apply performance patterns                   | Batch similar operations, minimize branch overhead, cache results               | Apply optimization patterns for best parallel performance.          |
