| **[[LC2.2.3.1 Branch Tuple Syntax]]**                 | Define branch syntax                         | (condition, runnable) tuples, list of branches                                  | Define branches as (condition, runnable) tuples.                    |
| **[[LC2.2.3.2 Condition-Runnable Pairs]]**            | Pair conditions with chains                  | Matching conditions to handlers, pair structure                                 | Each condition pairs with its handler runnable.                     |
| **[[LC2.2.3.3 Branch Ordering]]**                     | Order branches correctly                     | First-match wins, priority order, overlap handling                              | Branches are evaluated in order; first match wins.                  |
| **[[LC2.2.3.4 Syntax Patterns]]**                     | Use common patterns                          | Lambda conditions, RunnableLambda, inline definitions                           | Use lambda functions for simple branch conditions.                  |
| **[[LC2.2.3.5 Branch Readability]]**                  | Write maintainable branches                  | Named conditions, clear structure, documentation                                | Use named functions and clear structure for readability.            |
