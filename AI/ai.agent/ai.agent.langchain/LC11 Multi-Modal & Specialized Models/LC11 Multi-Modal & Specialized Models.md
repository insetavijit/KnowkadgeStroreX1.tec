# [[LC11 Multi-Modal & Specialized Models]]

Master working with vision models, audio models, and specialized LLMs. Learn image understanding, vision-language tasks, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech integration. Understand multi-modal RAG, image captioning, and visual question answering. Build applications that process images, audio, and video alongside text. Multi-modal AI is rapidly expanding—essential for modern applications.
