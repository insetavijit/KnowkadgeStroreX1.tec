# Multi-Image Inputs: Comparing and Sequencing

VLMs can process **multiple images** in a single request.
This enables comparison, verification, and sequence understanding.

---

## 1. Multiple Images in One Call

```python
message = HumanMessage(
    content=[
        {"type": "text", "text": "Compare these two product photos. Which looks more professional?"},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_url_1}},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image_url_2}}
    ]
)
```

The model sees both images simultaneously and can compare them directly.

---

## 2. Common Multi-Image Use Cases

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Before/After** | Compare states (renovations, edits) |
| **Find Differences** | Spot changes between versions |
| **Quality Check** | Compare reference vs actual |
| **Sequence Understanding** | Steps in a process (cooking, assembly) |
| **Multi-View** | Same object from different angles |

---

## 3. Image Sequence Reasoning

For step-by-step instructions:

```python
message = HumanMessage(
    content=[
        {"type": "text", "text": "These images show steps of a recipe. Describe what's happening in each step."},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": step1_url}},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": step2_url}},
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": step3_url}},
    ]
)
```

**Tip**: Order matters. First image in the list is "Image 1" in the model's perspective.

---

## 4. Token Costs

Each image costs tokens. Rough estimates:

| Resolution | Approx Tokens |
|------------|---------------|
| **512x512** | ~85 tokens |
| **1024x1024** | ~170 tokens |
| **2048x2048** | ~680+ tokens |

**Warning**: Sending 10 high-res images can quickly exhaust context limits.

---

## 5. Batching vs Multi-Image

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Image (1 call, N images)** | Comparison, ordering, find-differences |
| **Batch (N calls, 1 image each)** | Independent analysis (captioning each) |

Multi-Image:
```python
# One call, compares both
llm.invoke([message_with_two_images])
```

Batch:
```python
# Parallel calls, independent
llm.batch([message_1, message_2])
```

---

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **2 Images** | A/B comparison |
| **3+ Images** | Sequences, steps |
| **~10 limit** | Beyond this, batch separately |
