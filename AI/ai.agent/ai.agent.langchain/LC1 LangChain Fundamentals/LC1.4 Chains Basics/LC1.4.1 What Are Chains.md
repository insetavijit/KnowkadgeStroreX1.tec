| **[[LC1.4.1.1 Chain Concept]]**                       | Understand what chains represent             | Chains as workflows, multi-step processing, abstraction over operations         | Chains compose multiple operations into a single workflow.          |
| **[[LC1.4.1.2 Composing LLM Calls]]**                 | Combine LLM with other operations            | Pre-processing, post-processing, chained LLM calls                              | Chains allow combining LLM calls with data transformations.         |
| **[[LC1.4.1.3 Chain as Workflow]]**                   | View chains as pipelines                     | Input-process-output, data flow, orchestration                                  | Think of chains as data processing pipelines.                       |
| **[[LC1.4.1.4 Chain vs Single LLM Call]]**            | Know when to use chains                      | Complexity threshold, multi-step needs, simple vs complex tasks                 | Use chains when a task needs multiple processing steps.             |
| **[[LC1.4.1.5 Chain Philosophy]]**                    | Understand design principles                 | Modularity, composability, reusability, separation of concerns                  | Chains embody composable, modular design principles.                |
