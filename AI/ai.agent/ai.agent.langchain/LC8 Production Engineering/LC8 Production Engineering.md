# [[LC8 Production Engineering]]

Build production-ready LangChain applications with proper error handling, observability, security, and deployment. Learn streaming, caching, rate limiting, and cost optimization. Understand monitoring, tracing, testing, and CI/CD. Master secrets management, input validation, and security best practices. Production engineering separates prototypes from reliable, scalable systems.
