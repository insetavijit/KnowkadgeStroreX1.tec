|**Subtopic**|**Focus & Purpose**|**Key Concepts / Details**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[3.6.1 Reducer Pattern]]**|Understand reducer concept|Reducer function, state + action = new state, Redux influence|Reducers transform state based on actions.|
|**[[3.6.2 Dispatch Function]]**|Dispatch actions|dispatch function, action objects, action types, payloads|Dispatch sends actions to the reducer.|
|**[[3.6.3 Action Objects]]**|Structure actions properly|type property, payload, action creators, action constants|Actions describe what happened.|
|**[[3.6.4 Complex State]]**|Manage complex state|Multiple related values, nested state, state transitions|useReducer excels with complex state logic.|
|**[[3.6.5 useReducer vs useState]]**|Choose the right hook|When to use each, complexity threshold, team familiarity|useReducer suits complex state transitions.|
|**[[3.6.6 Reducer Composition]]**|Combine multiple reducers|Multiple reducers, combining logic, sub-reducers|Compose reducers for organized state.|
|**[[3.6.7 useReducer with Context]]**|Combine with Context API|Global state pattern, dispatch in context, state management|useReducer + Context creates Redux-like patterns.|
