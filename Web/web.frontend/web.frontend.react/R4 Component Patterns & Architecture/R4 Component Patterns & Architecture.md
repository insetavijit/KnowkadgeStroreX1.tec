# R4 Component Patterns & Architecture

Master React component patterns for scalable applications. Learn composition, higher-order components, render props, and compound components. Pattern knowledge separates junior from senior developers.

|Topic|Focus & Purpose|
|---|---|
|**[[R4.1 Component Composition]]**|Children pattern; slot pattern; component composition; avoiding prop drilling; flexible components. Composition patterns.|
|**[[R4.2 Higher-Order Components]]**|HOC concept; creating HOCs; wrapping components; prop injection; HOC composition; when to use. HOC pattern.|
|**[[R4.3 Render Props]]**|Render prop pattern; function as child; sharing behavior; flexibility; render prop vs hooks. Render props.|
|**[[R4.4 Compound Components]]**|Compound pattern; implicit state sharing; flexible APIs; component context; controlled compounds. UI patterns.|
|**[[R4.5 Container/Presentational]]**|Separation of concerns; container components; presentational components; smart vs dumb; modern alternatives. Architecture pattern.|
|**[[R4.6 Error Boundaries]]**|Error boundary concept; componentDidCatch; getDerivedStateFromError; fallback UI; error recovery. Error handling.|
