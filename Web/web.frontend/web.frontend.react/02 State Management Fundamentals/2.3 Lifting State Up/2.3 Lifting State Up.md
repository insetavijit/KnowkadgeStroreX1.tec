|**Subtopic**|**Focus & Purpose**|**Key Concepts / Details**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[2.3.1 Shared State]]**|Identify need for shared state|Multiple components needing same data, synchronization, single source of truth|Shared state keeps components in sync.|
|**[[2.3.2 State Lifting]]**|Move state to common ancestor|Finding common parent, lifting process, refactoring steps|Lift state to the lowest common ancestor.|
|**[[2.3.3 Prop Drilling]]**|Pass state through components|Intermediate components, deep prop passing, drilling problems|Prop drilling passes data through component layers.|
|**[[2.3.4 Component Communication]]**|Enable sibling communication|Callbacks to parent, state flows down, events flow up|Children communicate via parent callbacks.|
|**[[2.3.5 State Ownership]]**|Determine where state belongs|Single source of truth, state location decisions, ownership rules|State should live in the component that uses it most.|
|**[[2.3.6 Inverse Data Flow]]**|Pass callbacks to children|Callback props, child-to-parent communication, event handlers|Callbacks enable children to update parent state.|
|**[[2.3.7 State Colocation]]**|Keep state close to usage|Colocation principle, local vs lifted state, performance benefits|Colocate state with components that need it.|
