|**Subtopic**|**Focus & Purpose**|**Key Concepts / Details**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[V2.3.5.1 Computed Advantages]]**|When to use computed|Caching, reactive dependencies, declarative, automatic updates|Use computed for derived reactive values.|
|**[[V2.3.5.2 Methods Advantages]]**|When to use methods|No caching, explicit calls, side effects allowed, imperative|Use methods for actions and non-cached logic.|
|**[[V2.3.5.3 Performance Differences]]**|Compare performance|Computed caches, methods always run, performance implications|Computed is faster for expensive operations.|
|**[[V2.3.5.4 Caching Impact]]**|Understand caching|Computed caches between calls, methods recalculate every time|Methods run on every access, computed doesn't.|
|**[[V2.3.5.5 Best Practices]]**|Choose correctly|Computed for derived state, methods for actions, usage guidelines|Use computed for calculations, methods for actions.|
