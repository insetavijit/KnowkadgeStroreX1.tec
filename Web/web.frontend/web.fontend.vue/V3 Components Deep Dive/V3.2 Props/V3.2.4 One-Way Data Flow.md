|**Subtopic**|**Focus & Purpose**|**Key Concepts / Details**|**One-Line Recall**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[[V3.2.4.1 Props Down]]**|Data flows down|Parent to child only, Unidirectional binding, Downward flow|Props flow from parent down to child.|
|**[[V3.2.4.2 Unidirectional Flow]]**|One-way binding|Never flows back up, Predictable state, Single direction|Data flow is always unidirectional.|
|**[[V3.2.4.3 Data Flow Rules]]**|Flow principles|Props are read-only in child, Events up for changes, Clear rules|Child cannot modify parent via props.|
|**[[V3.2.4.4 Preventing Mutations]]**|Immutable props|Props should not be mutated, Use local copy, Mutation prevention|Never mutate props directly.|
|**[[V3.2.4.5 Flow Benefits]]**|Why one-way|Predictable state, Easier debugging, Clear data flow|One-way flow makes apps predictable.|
