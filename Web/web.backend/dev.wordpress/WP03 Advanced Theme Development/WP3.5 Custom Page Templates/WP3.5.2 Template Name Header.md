| **Subtopic** | **Focus & Purpose** | **Key Concepts / Details** | **One-Line Recall** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[[WP3.5.2.1 Syntax Rules]]** | Getting it right | Case sensitivity, strict syntax `Template Name:` | Must be inside a PHP comment block at the very top. |
| **[[WP3.5.2.2 Template Post Type]]** | Expanded scope | `Template Post Type: post, page, event` (WP 4.7+) | Use page templates on Posts or CPTs too. |
| **[[WP3.5.2.3 File Naming]]** | Best practices | Descriptive names, avoiding reserved filenames | Give the file a recognizable name like `tpl-about.php`. |
| **[[WP3.5.2.4 Template Hierarchy]]** | Priority | Manual selection overrides `page.php` and `index.php` | Manually selected templates win over defaults. |
| **[[WP3.5.2.5 Cache Issues]]** | Troubleshooting | Theme data caching (why new templates might not appear) | If it doesn't show up, try switching themes back and forth. |
